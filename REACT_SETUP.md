# React Reports Setup (Webpack Build)

This project now includes React-based student reports using **Webpack** for building and **CDN React** for runtime.

## What's New

- **React Components**: Modern React components for reports
- **Webpack Build**: Stable build process using Webpack instead of Vite
- **Department + Course Filtering**: Filter students by department, then by course
- **Export Options**: CSV export and print functionality
- **Real-time Preview**: See filtered results before exporting

## Files Added

- `resources/js/react/simple-reports.jsx` - Main reports component
- `webpack.config.js` - Webpack build configuration
- `public/react-test.html` - Test page for React functionality
- `public/js/reports.js` - Built React component (generated by Webpack)

## How to Use

### 1. Development
```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Build React components
npm run build:react

# Or use development mode with watch
npm run dev
```

### 2. Testing the React Reports
1. Build the components: `npm run build:react`
2. Visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/react-test.html`
3. Use the department and course filters
4. Export to CSV or print the report

### 3. Integration with Existing App
The React components can be integrated into your existing Laravel views by:
1. Adding a container div: `<div id="react-reports-container"></div>`
2. Including the built JS: `<script src="js/reports.js"></script>`
3. Calling: `window.mountSimpleReports()`

## Features

- **Department Filter**: Select a department first
- **Course Filter**: Then filter by specific courses within the department
- **Real-time Preview**: See filtered data in a table
- **CSV Export**: Download filtered data as CSV
- **Print Functionality**: Print reports directly from browser
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

## Build Process

- **Webpack**: More stable than Vite for this setup
- **Babel**: Transpiles JSX and modern JavaScript
- **Output**: Generates `public/js/reports.js` ready for use

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Issues**: Run `npm run build:react` to rebuild
- **Component Not Loading**: Check browser console for errors
- **Data Not Loading**: Ensure your Laravel API endpoints are working

## Next Steps

1. Test the React reports functionality
2. Integrate into your existing reports page
3. Add more report types (faculty, enrollment, etc.)
4. Enhance with additional export formats
